# ARP-Cache-Poisoning

ARP poisoning is utilized to intercept network traffic between a victim's 
IP address and the gateway. The captured packets are stored in a .pcap file for 
analysis. Using Nmap, open ports on the victim's system are identified, providing 
insights into potential vulnerabilities. Pyshark is employed to generate a 
summary of the intercepted packets Additionally, social engineering techniques 
are employed to capture sensitive information exchanged over the network
